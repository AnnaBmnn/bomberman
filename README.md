Pixel Pirate
===================


Pixel Pirate is a pirate version of a **Bomberman**, created by five HETIC students. The goal of the game is still the same : launch bomb and collect bonus in order to kill the artificial intelligence. The only thing which is changing in this version, is that you are playing an **evil pirate** against the famous **commodore James Norrington**.
